## Project for Visualisierung und HCI class
This application visualizes satellites orbiting earth. The only library used is the OpenTK library for low level access to OpenGL from C#. OpenTK is able to run on Windows with the .Net Framework and under Linux or OSX with Mono. The codebase therefor should compile and run without any modifications under all of these operating systems.
